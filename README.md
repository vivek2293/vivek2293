Hi,  
This is Vivek Kumar and I welcome you to my Github profile.

Currently, I am a freshman in Computer Science and Engineering at The Indian Institute of Information Technology, Surat.
I do Competetive Programming to nourish my coding skills and better understand the functioning of Computers in executing a particular task.
I wish to work on learning about adding intelligence to the computer and I also know it is a long way to go for mastering this. I believe in the importance of learning basics in-depth and the importance of small steps to achieve success. Therefore, I am currently taking small steps every day to achieve this.

Currently, I am working on Web development in my free time.

If you want any collaboration or help, feel free to reach me on:
